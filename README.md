This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Trailforge project

The project grid places Trailforge after the locked Diffwise card. Its static,
code-native system graphic is in `TrailforgeThumbnail`; no demo or fabricated UI
screenshots are used.

- Case study: `/projects/trailforge`
- Technical reading page: `/projects/trailforge/description`
- Full technical reference download: `/projects/trailforge/description.pdf`

The downloadable PDF is the supplied, unchanged 46-page v0.1.0a1 guide. The web
study summarizes its implementation in the portfolio's native typography and
diagram style. `tools/documents/export-pdfs.mjs` regenerates the other projects'
typeset studies, not this original reference. Replace Trailforge's PDF only when
an updated guide is intentionally supplied.

With the local preview running, check the new project and the existing grid:

```bash
node tools/preview/check-trailforge.mjs http://localhost:3200
node tools/preview/check-projects.mjs http://localhost:3200
```
